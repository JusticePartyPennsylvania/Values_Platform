Article 1, Section27 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania states that the people of Pennsylvania have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and aesthetic values of the environment, that PA’s public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come and that the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them. JPPA finds that the Commonwealth pays little heed to this section of our Constitution, and believes this article needs to be vigorously enforced to protect PA’s public lands and natural resources from destructive commercial exploitation, and hold corporate polluters accountable for clean-up. We support a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” on public lands, believe local communities should be empowered to regulate local fracking, and support regulations to better protect PA’s environment from fracking damage and to ensure the public is fully informed about fracking chemicals and activities.
