The Justice Party of Pennsylvania recognizes that human activity is a cause of global climate change and that this poses a threat to civilization as we know it and we seek to have Pennsylvania do its part along with other states to halt, if possible reverse, and repair damage from climate change for the security of the nation and the world. JPPA would like PA to conserve energy, dramatically reduce consumption of fossil fuels, and adopt policies, including tax incentives, to transition toward sustainable energy sources. JPPA seeks to encourage local energy generation, e.g. houses with solar panels.
