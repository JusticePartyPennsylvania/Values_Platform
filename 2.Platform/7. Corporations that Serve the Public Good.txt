The Justice Party of Pennsylvania seeks to abolish corporate personhood, by Constitutional amendment to clarify that corporations are not persons and are not entitled to any civil rights: that civil rights pertain only to natural persons. The JPPA believes corporate interests, e.g. profit, should be subordinate to the public interest, including the interests of consumers and employees and that the Commonwealth should eliminate subsidies to and revoke the corporate charter of corporations that act against the public interest.
