The Justice Party of Pennsylvania advocates a corrections system that reduces crime, emphasizes restorative justice, and rehabilitates those convicted of crimes, with equality under the law without discrimination. JPPA seeks to eliminate for-profit prisons and other for-profit corrections facilities, treat inmates humanely, and provide adequate living space, health care, and education and vocational training for their rehabilitation. JPPA believes PA should abolish capital punishment because the death penalty has historically been applied in ways that discriminate against the poor and racial minorities, has resulted in the execution of innocent people, and is not necessary in modern society.
