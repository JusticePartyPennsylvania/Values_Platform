The Justice Party of Pennsylvania supports community policing where police know, cooperate with, and serve the communities they patrol, and respects suspects' rights. JPPA seeks an end to the practice of “stop and frisk” as a violation of basic civil rights, and opposes the trend toward police militarization. JPPA advocates for the dismissal of any police who use excessive force or violate the law, and preserving the right of the public to video record police activities, e.g. arrests, that occur in a public environment.
