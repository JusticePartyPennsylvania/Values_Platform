The Justice Party believes every child has a right to quality education, pre-school through high school. Beyond that, Justice Party seeks to provide, via national policy, every American who desires it with up to four years of publicly-funded job training or certification, trade apprenticeship, or college education, conditional on continued satisfactory progress. JPPA is not opposed to homeschooling, charter, or private schooling, nor to providing students (and parents) a variety of educational options within the framework of public education. JPPA is opposed to funding formulas that take disproportionate funding away from public schools for students who opt to use an alternative and/or effectively privatize tax dollars by giving for-profit private education money in excess of reasonable tuition costs for each such student.
