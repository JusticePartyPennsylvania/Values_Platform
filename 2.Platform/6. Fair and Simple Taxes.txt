The Justice Party of Pennsylvania desires a tax system that is fair and simple, meaning the tax burden is distributed in proportion to the benefits enjoyed by being part of Pennsylvania, corporate taxes are on the same footing as personal taxes, and tax forms are simple for people to complete and return. JPPA seeks to eliminate commonly abused "loophole" tax deductions, exclusions, and tax credits.
