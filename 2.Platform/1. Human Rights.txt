The Justice Party of Pennsylvania calls for all people and all governments to recognize and uphold human rights – those which one should have merely by virtue of being a person – including: life ; access to clean air, water, food, medical care and shelter sufficient for a basic quality of life; liberty; the right to live in peace; freedom from inhumane treatment such as torture; the right to bodily integrity and sexual and reproductive freedom; freedom of conscience; and freedom of religion. JPPA seeks to end poverty, hunger, and homelessness; end human trafficking and slavery; and end indefinite detention and torture.

[Note: JPPA understands the right to life to be a right of the living, without implication or extension to the as yet unborn.]
