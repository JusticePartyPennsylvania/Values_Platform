The Justice Party of Pennsylvania supports healthcare reform that: ensures universal access to basic and emergency healthcare for everyone, substantially reduces the total cost per capita of health care, putting Pennsylvania in line with other industrialized nations, levels the playing field for health care costs among employers, is portable and not tied to employment status, breaks the oligopolies that dominate the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, emphasizes healthy living and preventative health care, ensures patients and their doctors the right to choose the best course of treatment, and does not require people to buy a product from a private for-profit vendor. We believe expanded Medicaid is a good way to do this.
