The Justice Party of Pennsylvania is committed to fostering an economy that provides every American with basic economic security, ensures that everyone who wants paid employment has maximum opportunities to get it, and pays a living wage such that a full-time worker can support a family above the poverty threshold, but believes many of the policies to provide these goals should be adopted at the state level to avoid competition between state economies. JPPA seeks to curb extreme economic inequality.
