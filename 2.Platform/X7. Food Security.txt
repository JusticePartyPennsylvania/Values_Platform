The Justice Party believes government should protect the quality and safety of Pennsylvanian’s food and water supply.  JPPA encourages local, decentralized, sustainable, and organic food production. JPPA supports restrictions on the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in foods until testing can determine the safety of each GMO, requiring labeling of GMO foods, and protect the rights of non-GMO farmers. JPPA seeks to ensure that the safety of agricultural workers is maintained, that livestock animals are treated humanely, and that the use of chemicals, hormones, and antibiotics that pass into the food and water supply is minimized.
