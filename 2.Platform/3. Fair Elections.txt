Article 1, Section 5 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania says PA elections shall be free and equal and that laws shall not interfere with free exercise of the right of suffrage. The Justice Party of Pennsylvania seeks to make elections fair and democratic, remove the corrupting influence of money from elections, and rescue our electoral processes from co-optation by the Republican and Democratic parties.  JPPA seeks to modify Pennsylvania elections to eliminate the spoiler effect, to encourage greater choice of candidates in each election, maximizing opportunities for political representation and a meaningful vote, and ensure that all Pennsylvanians can vote and have access to the polls. JPPA is opposed to mandatory Voter ID, which serves no useful purpose, unless it can be shown that it does not effective disenfranchise or deter any voters. JPPA seeks to eliminate ballot access laws that discriminate against third party or independent candidates, and open political debates to all candidates who demonstrate a modicum of support.
