These values collectively, with justice first and foremost, may be applied variously to civil, economic, social, and environmental aspects of our society.  Civil Justice includes protecting every persons human and civil rights and liberties, having fair and democratic elections, equality under the law for all, requiring government be accountable to the people rather than to bankers, wealthy corporations and powerful individuals, maintaining a responsible national budget, and having a fair and simple tax system. Economic Justice involves appropriately regulating the economy so corporations serve the public good, and enacting economic policies that maximize basic economic security and fair economic opportunities so people have the best opportunity to prosper and achieve their version of the American Dream. Social Justice includes eliminating poverty, hunger, and homelessness, providing our youth with fair, strong opportunities to obtain a quality education, providing universal healthcare coverage, having rational law enforcement and corrections policies, and recognizing that our nation is a community.  Environmental Justice means keeping our air, water, and food supplies clean and healthy, taking better care of our natural environment, adopting sustainable practices, and reducing our impact on the environment and climate.
